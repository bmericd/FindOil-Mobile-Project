# FindOil-Mobile-Project

A mobile application application written with Kotlin which gathers information from the nearby gas stations and displays their position on a map alongside with the current and predicted future gas prices.

The nearby gas stations are shown on the map with their logos as their markers in a customizable radius. The user can press on a spesific logo to see that individual gas station's prices in a container appearing on the bottom of the screen. The user can also press the left-most button on the navigation bar to automaticaly set a route to the selected gas station in the Google Maps application, which the user is later redirected to automatically.
